   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>I was born in Argentina but I came here when I was only 2 years old and have lived in Utah my entire life. 
       I learned Spanish as my first language and as time went on I learned English.
       I love camping, hiking, watching basketball, coding, spending time with my family, playing video games, lifting weights, and traveling with my girlfriend. 
       Fun fact about me is that I have multiple reptiles as pets. I have a turtle, a bearded dragon, geckos, and a lizard. I like reptiles because reptiles, at least the ones I have, are clean and easy to take care of. 
       Exploring and seeking adventure is my favorite hobby and I spend all summer seeking that next adventure.
