   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>I was born in Argentina but I came here when I was only 2 years old and have lived in Utah my entire life. 
       I learned Spanish as my first language and as time went on I learned English.
      I love camping, hiking, playing every sport, coding, spending time with my family, playing video games, lifting weights, and traveling with my girlfriend.  </p>
